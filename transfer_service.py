TransferService — orchestrates the lead → sale transfer.

This is the KEY business gate. It:
1. Validates AI score (hard threshold from config)
2. Validates business domain presence
3. Creates sale record
4. Updates lead stage to TRANSFERRED

The AI score is a NECESSARY condition but NOT sufficient alone.
Human must explicitly call the transfer endpoint.
